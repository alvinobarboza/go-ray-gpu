# GPU Ray Tracer

From [go-ray-demo](https://github.com/alvinobarboza/go-ray-demo) but computing everything in the GPU, using shaders. As before, using [raylib](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go) and now GLSL.

# Improvements

-   Compute every ray on GPU(shader/GLSL).
-   Resizable screen/window.
-   Camera movement improved to mouse(As a FP camera is expected to be).
-   Better input handling.
-   Better project layout(in my opnion).
-   Massive FPS boost.
